      <h3> Samuel Scott</h3>
      <p>Hi, my name is Sam, this is my portfolio! I love video games; So much so that I abandoned a dead-end factory job in order to pursue a career in the games industry and rebuild my life from scratch. 
          I was originally concerned about going back into education because of being over the age of twenty-one when I went for my BTEC, 
          but I have made some great friends along the way and regained a lot of confidence. Being on a Games Development course,
          it came as a great surprise that I would be working with web development languages like HTML, 
          CSS and Javascript; however itâ€™s a challenge that I welcome.</p>
