        <br>
        <p>I love TV and Film, as well as video games, my main ambition in life has always been to find myself working in either the film or games industry. I chose games as gaming itself has become more cinematic over the years, so it’s like both my interests have merged together; Since I enjoy being creative and coming up with my own ideas, my dream job would be a lead game design position, as I’d have the freedom to bring my own ideas into the development process.</p>

        <h4> Samuel Scott</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Hi, my name is Sam, this is my portfolio! I love video games; So much so that I abandoned a dead-end factory job in order to pursue a career in the games industry and rebuild my life from scratch. 
          I was originally concerned about going back into education because of being over the age of twenty-one when I went for my BTEC, 
          but I have made some great friends along the way and regained a lot of confidence. Being on a Games Development course,
          it came as a great surprise that I would be working with web development languages like HTML, 
          CSS and Javascript; however its a challenge that I welcome.</p>

        <h4>Ducky</h4>
        <br>
        <p>This Ducky, the little yellow duck that helps me out when i'm in a pickle and can't work out a problem i'm having. Talking to Ducky helps me with my work because when I need to explain my problem to someone and no one else is around; good old faithful Ducky will be there to listen as I'm trying to explain my problem, the solution to the problem might be revealed to me as talk about it to him.</p>
