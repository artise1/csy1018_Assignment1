        <h4>Artise Brown</h4>
        <br>
        <p>I love TV and Film, as well as video games, my main ambition in life has always been to find myself working in either the film or games industry. I chose games as gaming itself has become more cinematic over the years, so it’s like both my interests have merged together; Since I enjoy being creative and coming up with my own ideas, my dream job would be a lead game design position, as I’d have the freedom to bring my own ideas into the development process.</p>

        <h4> Samuel Scott</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Hi, my name is Sam, this is my portfolio! I love video games; So much so that I abandoned a dead-end factory job in order to pursue a career in the games industry and rebuild my life from scratch. 
          I was originally concerned about going back into education because of being over the age of twenty-one when I went for my BTEC, 
          but I have made some great friends along the way and regained a lot of confidence. Being on a Games Development course,
          it came as a great surprise that I would be working with web development languages like HTML, 
          CSS and Javascript; however it’s a challenge that I welcome.</p>

        <h4>Radu-Andrei Dumitras</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Since a young age I have been passionate about video games, so it come to no surprise that I have enrolled for game development course, but it does come as a surprise that I have made the step forward to this specific university. I never had envisioned that I would come to programming course because I used to do art in my previous school. Then it was always a joke because it seemed that I would not be able to do it. I have changed my mind, art was not my best tool from the toolbox, hopefully I will show good morals and do my best.  </p>

        <h4>Ducky</h4>
        <br>
        <p>This Ducky, the little yellow duck that helps me out when i'm in a pickle and can't work out a problem i'm having. Talking to Ducky helps me with my work because when I need to explain my problem to someone and no one else is around; good old faithful Ducky will be there to listen as I'm trying to explain my problem, the solution to the problem might be revealed to me as talk about it to him.</p>
